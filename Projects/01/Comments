# Comments on Program Assignment 1: echo client!

# __Deadline Febuary 15__ or 02-15-2015

## test and submit on nrl CORE
## C-Progam (TCP Socket):
- Must be in C
1. connect TCP argv[1] with port argv[2]
2. Read stdin and write that stuff to TCP (argv[1]) socket until stdin ends (end of file <- whats this character ctrl-x or something?)
3. Shutdown socket for writing ($ man shutdown	to explain how)
4. Read what the TCP socket has and write that stuff to stdout until the socket ends (end of file because the other side has closed). __NO ADDITITIONAL OUTPUT SHOULD BE SENT TO STDOUT__
5. _Exit!!!!_: IMPORTANT if you dont exit, the tests will fail.
6. Name the file "p1.c" and the executable "p1".

## Deliverables (shell script, MAKEFILE)
### Shell Script (tests.sh)
__THIS FILE MUST__
- Compile code using MAKEFILE
- Read a comma seprated list of < host >, < port >, < data >, < name > (with no header line @ beginning)
 - Should be done using first file passed in as an argument (I think it should be $ tests.sh conn_list.csv  // or something of the sort	
- For each line that is read from the file the program (shell script: tests.sh) should run echo client with the host and port, pipe "data" (the string that is sent by your echo client) into your client, and append output of your client to < name >.out	(creating < name >.out if it does not exist)
